A tabletop AR terrain map to inspect hiking trails and associated terrain.

## How is it built?
I built it in Unity using the Mapbox SDK and ARCore.

## Why?
Have you really never seen a sci-fi movie with a holographic map and said "that would be cool as hell"? 
Maybe a better answer is that static or even web maps don't always give a sense of scale and "tactility". This is one possible answer to that.

## How can I use it?
It is not yet available on any app stores, but you are more than welcome to clone the repo and develop it yourself.
